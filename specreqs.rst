System Requirements
--------------------------------------

.. warning::
    This app requires a computer with an NVIDIA graphics card with `CUDA <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone>`_ installed.

Because **VirtualRocks** is a computationally intensive app, the speed at which the app runs depends heavily on
graphics card quality and the amount of available RAM.


* Windows OS
* A CUDA-enabled GPU is needed to run the dense reconstruction step in :ref:`Colmap <colmap>`.
* 16gb of RAM (most important for :ref:`pymeshlab <meshlab>`)
