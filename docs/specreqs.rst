Required and Suggested Computer Specs
--------------------------------------

.. warning::
    This app requires a computer with an NVIDA graphics card with `CUDA <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone>`_ installed.

Because **VirtualRocks** is a computationally intensive app, better graphics cards and larger RAM have a great impact on how 
quickly you can make a 3D model. 

A CUDA-enabled GPU is needed to run the dense reconstruction step in COLMAP.
