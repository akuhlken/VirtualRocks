VirtualRocks's documentation!
========================================
**VirtualRocks** is a CS senior capstone project made over the course of the 2023/24
school year. It serves as a pipeline to turn a set of images into a 3D mesh with a 
high quality texture, and turns that 3D mesh into a VR headset-ready experience.

   This project is under active development.
