Licensing
----------

* Colmap's licensing info: `Colmap licensing <https://colmap.github.io/license.html>`_
* MeshLab licensing info: `MeshLab licensing <https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/meshlab/blob/main/LICENSE.txt>`_
* pymeshlab (if we care): `PyMeshLab licensing <https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/PyMeshLab/blob/docs/LICENSE>`_

Seems like we have to use GNU v. 3.0 while including the things that Colmap wants up to include for its licensing.
