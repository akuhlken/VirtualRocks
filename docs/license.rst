Licensing
----------

* Colmap's licensing info: `Colmap licensing <https://colmap.github.io/license.html>`_
* MeshLab licensing info: `MeshLab licensing <https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/meshlab/blob/main/LICENSE.txt>`_
* pymeshlab: `PyMeshLab licensing <https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/PyMeshLab/blob/docs/LICENSE>`_

pymeshlab also includes this:

| @software{pymeshlab,
|   author       = {Alessandro Muntoni and Paolo Cignoni},
|   title        = {{PyMeshLab}},
|   month        = jan,
|   year         = 2021,
|   publisher    = {Zenodo},
|   doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.4438750}
| }


Seems like we have to use GNU v. 3.0 while including the things that Colmap wants up to include for its licensing.
